### What are Channels and Kernels (according to EVA)?
### Why should we (nearly) always use 3x3 kernels?
### How many times to we need to perform 3x3 convolutions operations to reach close to 1x1 from 199x199 (type each layer output like 199x199 > 197x197...)
### How are kernels initialized? 
### What happens during the training of a DNN?
